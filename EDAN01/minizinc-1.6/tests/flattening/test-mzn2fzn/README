These flattening tests are divided into two kinds.

The 'binop' tests have models of the form prefix_*.mzn
and data files of the form prefix.*.dzn.
The run-prefix-tests scripts will run each .mzn model
against each .dzn data file.

The misc_*.mzn tests do not have data files.  These
are run via the run-misc-tests script.

Each test case has a corresponding .exp file with
the expected output.

The run-tests-interactive script will run all tests
and prompt for advice when an unexpected result is
produced (i.e., whether the .exp file should be
updated or not).

The run-tests-non-interactive script runs all tests
non-interactively and does not update any .exp files.
The output from this script is trimmed to highlight
any unexpected results.

NOTE that the flattening program used in these scripts
can be changed by setting the MZN2FZN shell variable.
The scripts otherwise default to using mzn2fzn.
