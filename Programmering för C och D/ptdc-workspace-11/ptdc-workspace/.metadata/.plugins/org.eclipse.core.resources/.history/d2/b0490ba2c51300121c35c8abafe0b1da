This package contains classes to represent a term. 

A term is either
 
  a constant like true or 3.14 represented by a string
  a variable like x and y represented by its name
  a function like f(x) and g(y, f(x)) represented by a its name and a list of terms
  
 The class TermList represents a list of terms. It has a constructor specified as
 
   public TermList(Term ... terms)
   
 It accepts any number of arguments of the type Term. They will be collected in an array  parameter
   Term [] terms;
   
 The interface Term specifies two methods. The substitute method has to be implemented properly.
 
 There two classes to test the Term classes. You may remove one of them. Initially all tests will fail
 since the computed values are null. 
 
   SimpleTestTerm that just prints expected and calculated values.
   
   TestTerm that uses the JUnit framework. You may need to "Fix the project setup" suggested by 
   the QuickFix icon to "Add the JUnit library to the build path".
